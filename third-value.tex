\hypertarget{neither-true-nor-false}{%
\section{Neither True Nor False}\label{neither-true-nor-false}}

So far we've assumed that every sentence is either true or false, and
not both. We did make one qualification to that when we started doing
modal logic, and said that sentences can be true at some worlds and
false at other worlds. But still everything is, at a particular world,
either true or false, and not both. There are, however, a series of
reasons for rejecting this assumption. I'll start by going over four
such reasons.

I do want to stress that these are \emph{reasons}, not necessarily
\emph{good reasons}. Indeed, the assumption that all sentences are true
or false, and not both, is very widely shared. So most people reject
these reasons. But still, they are reasons, and it's worth knowing about
them.

\hypertarget{open-future}{%
\subsection{Open Future}\label{open-future}}

Going back at least as far as Aristotle, many people have thought that
contingent claims about the future are not either true or false. This is
especially true for sentences that are about free choices about the
future. The standard example here (again as far back as Aristotle) is
``There will be a sea battle tomorrow''. The admirals (or generals)
might or might not decide in the morning whether to give battle. And
saying that it is now true (or false) that there will be a sea battle
might be thought to undermine their free will.

\hypertarget{paradoxes}{%
\subsection{Paradoxes}\label{paradoxes}}

Let \emph{L} be the sentence \emph{L is false}. Assume \emph{L} is true.
Then what \emph{L} says is the case; i.e., \emph{L} is false. That
contradicts the assumption that \emph{L} is true. Now assume \emph{L} is
false. Then things are the way that \emph{L} says things are. That is to
say, \emph{L} is true. This contradicts the assumption that \emph{L} is
false.

So assuming that \emph{L} is either true or false leads to a
contradiction. So \emph{L} is neither true nor false. So we need a third
truth value for sentences like \emph{L}.

\hypertarget{nonsense-and-non-reference}{%
\subsection{Nonsense and
Non-Reference}\label{nonsense-and-non-reference}}

Let \emph{C} be the sentence \emph{Green ideas sleep furiously}. This
has the syntactic form of a sentence, but maybe it doesn't really make a
meaningful claim. And maybe we should say that this really is a
sentence, it does have the syntactic form of one, but isn't true or
false. It isn't true because green ideas are not the kind of thing that
sleep furiously. But also green ideas don't sleep furiously, so it isn't
false.

The same kind of thing can happen with definite descriptions that are
don't pick out anyone. Let \emph{Q} be the sentence \emph{The (present)
Queen of the US lives in Ann Arbor}. Is that true or false? Well, it
isn't true; if it was I suspect I would have met her by now. But is it
false? That suggests that the Queen of the US lives somewhere else, and
that isn't true.

So these sentences like \emph{C} and \emph{Q} seem like they are neither
true nor false.

\hypertarget{vagueness}{%
\subsection{Vagueness}\label{vagueness}}

Consider the following four claims.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{-1}
\tightlist
\item
  Whether someone is rich is a function of how much money they have (in
  some sense of money they have).
\item
  Someone with no money is not rich.
\item
  Giving someone who is not rich a penny does not make them rich.
\item
  Jeff Bezos is rich.
\end{enumerate}

These seem inconsistent. Premise 2 suggests that you could take the
person with no money, give them a penny over and over again roughly 10
trillion times, and they'd still not be rich, despite having as much
money as Bezos. Either they are rich (contradicting 1 and 2), or they
are not despite having as much money as Bezos (contradicting 0 and 3).

What could have happened here? One natural thought is that the problem
is that there are \emph{borderline} cases of richness. Some people are
neither clearly rich nor clearly not rich. And the reason that premise 2
is plausible is that no penny can jump one over that borderline area.

If someone is in that borderline, the sentence \emph{That person is
rich} is arguably neither true nor false.

\hypertarget{four-reasons}{%
\subsection{Four Reasons}\label{four-reasons}}

So we have four reasons to think that sentences can be neither true nor
false. There are two philosophical problems, however.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Arguably none of these are very good reasons; though in each case we
  could literally spend a semester (or more) on the literature on them.
\item
  They are very different reasons, and the kind of non-standard logic
  they suggest is different in every case.
\end{enumerate}

We'll be mostly interested here in two.

\hypertarget{logics-and-valuations}{%
\section{Logics and Valuations}\label{logics-and-valuations}}

\hypertarget{valuation-functions}{%
\subsection{Valuation Functions}\label{valuation-functions}}

Assume that we don't have quantifiers, names, predicates, modals, or
anything else beyond the symbols from chapter one of the book. To be
more precise, assume we're working in the language with the following
characteristics.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  There are some sentence letters, \(p, q, r\), etc.
\item
  There are connectives \(\neg\), \(\wedge\), \(\vee\), \(\rightarrow\).
  We won't even use \(\equiv\), and we will use \(\rightarrow\) rather
  than \(\supset\) for \emph{if}, because we're sort of trying to
  capture natural language \emph{if}.
\item
  The sentence letters all stand for sentences.
\item
  If \(A, B\) are sentences, so are
  \(\neg A, A \wedge B, A \vee B, A \rightarrow B\).
\item
  There are no sentences other than what are generated through those
  last two points.
\end{itemize}

Then one can specify a logic for that language by fixing the values for
the following three things.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  What the \textbf{truth-values} are.
\item
  Which of those truth-values are \textbf{designated}.
\item
  What the values of \(\neg A, A \wedge B, A \vee B, A \rightarrow B\)
  are given the values of \(A, B\).
\end{enumerate}

We then use two definitions which will be constant across all the logics
we'll study the rest of the way in this course.

\begin{description}
\tightlist
\item[Logical Truth]
A sentence is a logical truth if it gets a \emph{designated} value no
matter what value the sentence letters that make it up take. These
logical truths are sometimes called \emph{tautologies}.
\item[Validity]
An argument is valid if whenever its premises take a designated value,
so does its conclusion.
\end{description}

Note that how we label the values doesn't matter for the logic. It's the
same logic whether you call the values True and False, or T and F, or 1
and 0. I'll mostly use numbers, because I think it makes it easier to
see some patterns in what we're doing.

\hypertarget{classical-logic}{%
\subsection{Classical Logic}\label{classical-logic}}

To get \textbf{classical} logic, the logic we studied back in chapter 1,
you can set these values as follows. The truth values are \(\{1,0\}\),
and the only designated value is \(1\). And the values of compound
sentences are given by these rules.\footnote{I'm going to list equations
  for these, rather than the tables as in the book for two reasons. One
  is that the book has the tables (in fact both books do), and seeing
  the equations is a useful comparison. The other is that the software
  I'm using doesn't make tables like those particularly easy to draw.}

\begin{align*}
v(\neg A) &= 1 - v(A) \\
v(A \wedge B) &= min(v(A), v(B)) \\
v(A \vee B) &= max(v(A), v(B)) \\
v(A \rightarrow B) &= v(\neg A \vee B) = min(1, 1 - v(A) + v(B)) 
\end{align*}

I've done two definitions for \(\rightarrow\) which are equivalent in
this setting because they very soon will become not equivalent.

It's not much work to check given these definitions that the logical
truths, and the validities, are just the ones we covered in chapter 1.
Indeed, the definitions we've used are pretty similar to the definitions
in chapter 1. But let's note one special case. Consider the sentence
\(p \vee \neg p\). There is only one sentence letter in this, \(p\), and
there are only two values in the logic, \(1, 0\), so there are only two
cases to check. If \(v(p) = 1\), then the maximum of \(v(p), v(\neg p)\)
will be 1, so \(v(p \vee \neg p)\) will be 1. If If \(v(p) = 0\), then
\(v(\neg p) = 1\), so again the maximum of \(v(p), v(\neg p)\) will be
1, so \(v(p \vee \neg p)\) will be 1. Either way,
\(v(p \vee \neg p) = 1\), so \(p \vee \neg p\) is a logical truth
\emph{in this logic}.

\hypertarget{strong-kleene-logic}{%
\subsection{Strong Kleene Logic}\label{strong-kleene-logic}}

The first \textbf{non-classical} logic we'll look at is called the
Strong Kleene logic. It's named after Stephen Kleene (1909-1994,
pronounced Klay-nee), a mathematician who spent most of his career at
Wisconsin-Madison, and developed a number of key concepts in theoretical
computer science. (He also apparently invented regular expressions, so
even if you haven't heard his name, you've probably used his work.)

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The logic has three truth values: \(1, ½, 0\).
\item
  The only designated value is \(1\).
\item
  The rules for the connectives are mostly just like classical logic.
\end{itemize}

\begin{align*}
v(\neg A) &= 1 - v(A) \\
v(A \wedge B) &= min(v(A), v(B)) \\
v(A \vee B) &= max(v(A), v(B)) \\
v(A \rightarrow B) &= v(\neg A \vee B)
\end{align*}

The only change I had to make was to only use one of the two definitions
for \(\rightarrow\), since the two definitions are not equivalent when
v(A) = v(B) = ½.

If all the sentence letters in a longer sentence get value ½, so does
the whole sentence. You can check this by going through the four rules.
In each case, if all the inputs are ½, so is the output. And ½ is not a
designated value. So there are \emph{no logical truths} in this logic.

Despite this, there are validities in the logic. In any logic defined
using designated values, \(A \vdash A\) will be a logical truth.
Whenever \(A\) is designated, \(A\) is designated. But there are more
substantive validities in this logic, such as
\(A, A \rightarrow B \vdash B\). Note that there are nine cases to check
to see that this works, but in all nine cases, either one of the
premises is not designated, or the conclusion is designated.

The Strong Kleene logic is plausibly an account of the paradoxes. Let's
not start with the paradoxical sentence \emph{L}, the so-called
\emph{liar sentence}, but instead with \emph{T}, the \emph{truth-teller
sentence}. \emph{T} is the sentence \emph{T is true}. It is consistent
to say that it is true; then things are just the way it says they are.
But it is also consistent to say that it is false. If \emph{T} is false,
then things are not the way \emph{T} says they are, so \emph{T} is
false. That's consistent as well. Nothing seems to settle whether
\emph{T} is true or false.

Interpret \(1\) as meaning that the world settles that the sentence is
true, \(0\) as that the world settles that the sentence is false, and ½
as that the world does not settle the sentence. If you understand
\emph{settling} in terms of a recursive process, the last one will be a
situation where the process does not terminate. On that understanding,
it makes sense to think that the value of \emph{T} is ½; if you try to
work out the value for \emph{T}, you'll have to first work out the value
for \emph{T}, and you'll end up in a loop.

And, crucially, the same thing will go for \emph{L}. What we want is
that \emph{L} takes the opposite value to what it itself takes. On the
one hand, that looks impossible. But more importantly, there isn't a
process for working that out; we don't define the value for \emph{L} in
terms of something simpler. So it makes sense that our theory gives it
the \emph{unsettled} value ½.

Kleene did a lot of work on recursion theory, and developed this logic
in part for this purpose, so this isn't entirely a made-up, just-so,
story about the logic. And Saul Kripke (who we met in the context of
modal logic) developed a theory of the semantic paradoxes that used the
Strong Kleene logic in just this way.

Even though there are no logical truths in the Strong Kleene logic, we
can recover something like classical logic in it. Let \(A\) be any
sentence that is a logical truth in classical logic, and let
\(p_1, \dots, p_n\) be the sentence letters in it. Then the argument
\(p_1 \vee \neg p_1, \dots, p_n \vee \neg p_n \vdash A\) will be a
logical truth. The point of the premises here is just to specify that
none of the sentence letters take the value ½. And when that happens,
we're back in classical logic. In computing terms, when we know that
every process will halt, we can use classical logic, but when we don't
know that, we have to be more careful.

\hypertarget{ux142ukasiewicz-logic}{%
\subsection{Łukasiewicz Logic}\label{ux142ukasiewicz-logic}}

Jan Łukasiewicz (1878-1956, pronounced very roughly Wook-a-say-vich) was
a Polish logician who is most famous for his development of Polish
notation.\footnote{We're not going into this. It was a way of writing
  arbitrarily complex logical/mathematical expressions without using
  brackets. On the one hand, it massively increased the range of things
  one could write in text-only systems, and produced much more compact
  expressions than standard notation. On the other hand, unless you
  worked in it for years, it was impossible to use intuitively. For both
  these reasons, it became very important in computing, and was the
  basis of some important early programming languages.} He was one of
many refugees from central Europe in the 1930s who became central to the
development of English-language philosophy after the war. Most of these
refugees ended up in America, and several in Britain, but Łukasiewicz
landed in Dublin.\footnote{According to Wikipedia, this was at the
  invitation of the Irish President, though the sourcing on that seems a
  little thin to me.}

Łukasiewicz enters our story because of his interest in the open future.
He thought that we needed a third truth value to account for sentences
like \emph{There will be a sea battle tomorrow}. So he developed the
following logic.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The logic has three truth values: \(1, ½, 0\).
\item
  The only designated value is \(1\).
\item
  The rules for the connectives are mostly just like classical logic.
\end{itemize}

\begin{align*}
v(\neg A) &= 1 - v(A) \\
v(A \wedge B) &= min(v(A), v(B)) \\
v(A \vee B) &= max(v(A), v(B)) \\
v(A \rightarrow B) &= min(1, 1 - v(A) + v(B)) 
\end{align*}

The only difference between this and the Strong Kleene logic is in the
last clause. We've used the other of the two definitions of
\(\rightarrow\). The only difference is in what happens when both \(A\)
and \(B\) are ½. In Strong Kleene, then \(A \rightarrow B\) is ½. In
Łukasiewicz, in that case \(A \rightarrow B\) is \(1\).

This in turn makes a huge difference. It means that in Łukasiewicz,
there \emph{are} logical truths. They all involve \(\rightarrow\). In
any sentence that does not have \(\rightarrow\), if all the sentence
letters get value ½, so does the whole. But the sentence
\(p \rightarrow p\) gets value 1 no matter what the value of \(p\), so
it is a logical truth. This makes a certain amount of sense given
Łukasiewicz's interests. We might think that it is uncertain whether
there will be a sea battle tomorrow, and hence uncertain whether any
ships will be sunk tomorrow, but certain that if there is a sea battle
tomorrow, some ships will be sunk tomorrow.

In classical logic, the following two things are equivalent.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(A \rightarrow B\) is a logical truth.
\item
  \(A \vdash B\) is a valid argument.
\end{itemize}

In Strong Kleene these can't be equivalent, since there are no logical
truths, but there are valid arguments. You might hope that this change
would mean they would be back to being equivalent in Łukasiewicz. But
they are not. Here is a counterexample:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \((p \wedge \neg p) \rightarrow q\) is \textbf{not} a logical truth.
  (Why not?!)
\item
  \(p \wedge \neg p \vdash q\) \textbf{is} a valid argument. (Why?!)
\end{itemize}

Is this a bad thing for Łukasiewicz logic? It does look a bit weird to
me, but maybe when we are working with the open future, weird things
will happen.

That's enough for today probably; next time we'll look at these logics
in more detail, and go over some other three valued logics.
